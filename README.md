**(the code in this repo is public as group work permits)**

This repo contains a MATLAB implemented interpreter for a custom target programming language, RGME. The class for which this interpreter was implemented, Cal Poly's Programming Languages course, included random assignments to use an impractical host language for the design of a custom target language. The course uses Racket as the main host language; these programs are **much** more robust than you see here. However, due to school policy, that code can not be posted publicly.

NOTE: this interpreter requires a separate parser to create the concrete expressions (ExprC) data types used in this interpreter. 

Facts about RGME (in this context):
- it's loosely typed
- uses lexical scoping
- can return high order functions
