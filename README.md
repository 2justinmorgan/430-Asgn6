**(the code in this repo is public as group work permits)

This repo contains a MATLAB implemented interpreter for a custom programming language, RGME.

NOTE: this interpreter requires a separate parser to create the concrete expressions (ExprC) data types used in this interpreter. 

Facts about RGME (in this context):
- it's loosely typed
- uses lexical scoping
- can return high order functions
